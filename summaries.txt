libraries
numpy is used to make numpy arrays
pandas is used to make dataframes(tables) from csv(comma separated values)
matplotlib is useful for making plots and graphs
seaborn is also useful for making plots
metrics helps to find the error score and accuracy score

#loading the csv data to pandas dataframe
#print first five rows in the dataframe
#print last 5 rows of the dataframe
#number of rows and columns
#getting basic information about the data ( the data types and what not)
#checking the no. of missing values
#getting the statistical measures of the data(mean , percentiles, max, std)
#finding the correlation of the data(if gold price increases and spx increases, then they are 
positively correlated
#construct a heatmap to understand the above correlation(graphical bit of correlation)
#print correlation values of the gold (summary of the columns that are negatively or positively correlated)
#checking the distribution of the gold price(distribution graph)
#splitting the features and target (the features are the stock price while the target is the gold price)
#splitting into tranining data and test data(80% will go to x train and 20% will go to x test and the coresponding gold prices will go to y-train and corresponding gold prices for the x test will go to ytest
#ML model training: random forest regressor
#prediction on test data(predicting the gold prices)
#rsquared error
#compare the actual values and predicted values in a plot
